# US Flight Delay Analysis (2003–2022)



## Overview
This project presents an **interactive analysis of U.S. flight delay data covering 20 years (2003–2022)**.  
The focus is on identifying **long-term trends, seasonal weather impacts, and airline operational performance** through a filter-driven analytical dashboard.

The project is designed as a **portfolio showcase**, highlighting data modeling, DAX calculations, and analytical visualization using Excel Power Pivot.
